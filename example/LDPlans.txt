Not really my favorite theme. Gonna just play it safe.

Theme: "Combine 2 Incompatible Themes"

Most logic idea so far is combining Trivia with Shooter

Ideas:

* Make the wrong answer harm you more than enemies


Game Name:
How Confusing


Since this is going on the repo, The data already there is placeholders that I will not include in the final Ludum Dare entry (If I even get to make the engine itself work)
